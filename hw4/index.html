    <h2 align="middle">Overview</h2>
    <p>In this project, I implemented the main functionality behind simulating the kinematics and appreance(s) of cloth. This involved modeling a cloth as point masses and springs, handling collisions of the cloth with itself and other objects, and finally creating shaders for rendering the cloth.</p>
  </div>

  <a href="https://cs184.eecs.berkeley.edu/sp23/docs/proj4-part-1">
  <h2 align="middle">Part 1: Masses and springs</h2>
  </a>
  <p>
    The way we model a cloth is by an array of point masses bound together by a web of springs. We use multiple types of springs to try to approximate as best as we can how a cloth would behave in real life. Structural springs are the most obvious ones; adjacent point masses should be connected to each other. Shearing springs are put implace so that the cloth doesn't easily shear. Bending springs are used so that the cloth is somewhat resistant to curving, instead of being able to crease easily.

    <blockquote><b>

      To do so, pause the simulation at the start with <kbd>P</kbd>, modify the values of interest, and then resume by pressing <kbd>P</kbd> again. 
      You can also restart the simulation at any time from the cloth's starting position by pressing <kbd>R</kbd>.

      <small>
      Describe the effects of changing the spring constant <code>ks</code>; how does the cloth behave from start to rest with a very low <code>ks</code>? 
      A high <code>ks</code>?
      </small>
    </b></blockquote>

    <p>
      With a very high <code>ks</code>, the cloth becomes more taut, ending in a flatter resting state. Conversely, a lower <code>ks</code> yields a less taut cloth, and sinks lower. However, this only applies up to some point, and after some threshold a smaller value of <code>ks</code> doesn't change anything. This is because of the constraints we put in place that no spring can extend more that 110% larger than its original size. Becuase of this, there is an upper limit to how far down the cloth can stretch.
    </p>


    <blockquote><b>
      <small>
        What about for <code>density</code>?
      </small>
    </b></blockquote>

    <p>
      Increasing density has an effect similar to decreasing <code>ks</code>, and vice versa. This should make sense: the acceleration from the spring force is proportional to <code>ks</code> and inversely proportional to the density. 
    </p>
    
    
    <blockquote><b>
      <small>
        What about for <code>damping</code>?
      </small>
    </b></blockquote>

    <p>
      Damping seems to control the intertia of the cloth. With high damping, the cloth moves much more slowly and smoothly, whereas with low damping the cloth is very bouncy and erratic, and doesn't settle easily.

  <h2 align="middle">Part 3: Handling collisions with other objects</h2>
  </a>

  <p>
    I implemented two types of object collisions: spheres and planes. They each had slight implementation differences, of course, but the idea behind both is the same. If in one time step, one point mass in the cloth would pass from one side of the boundary of the object in question to the other, we need to prevent that from happening. To do this, we modify the calculated next location for the point mass to be just above the surface. In calculating where this point is, we think of the point mass sort of sliding along the surface with a small amount of friction.

      The higher <code>ks</code> is, the more rigid the cloth looks. This is the effect of the bending springs, which with a high <code>ks</code> value will put up against more curvature.

      As before, having a higher density is very similar to having a lower <code>ks</code>, and having a lower density is similar to having a higher <code>ks</code>. When either denisty is lower or <code>ks</code> is higher, the cloth is much more resistant to curvature, and therefore is much less inclined to fold over. Whereas, when the cloth is less resistant to cutvature, it has less of a problem folding, and rests alright being folded multiple times.

    <blockquote><b>
    Explain in your own words what is a shader program and how vertex and fragment shaders work together to create lighting and material effects.
    </b></blockquote>

    <p>
      A shader program is responsible for calculating or approximating how objects behave visually in the lighting environment. In other words, it is responsible for taking a mesh, and determining what the surface actually looks like. Since shaders run many independent simple calculations, they can take advantage of paralellization on a GPU for a large boost in performance.
      
      <br><br>
      Vertex shaders will make calculations that have to do only with the vertices of the mesh. For example, a vertex shader could be responsible for slightly tweaking where the vertices are. On the other hand, fragment shaders are the next step in the rendering pipeline, and use the data from the vertex shaders. Fragment shaders give color values for what are more or less pixels on the screen. 
    </p>


    <blockquote><b>
    Explain the Blinn-Phong shading model in your own words. 
    Show a screenshot of your Blinn-Phong shader outputting only the ambient component, a screen shot only outputting the diffuse component, a screen shot only outputting the specular component, and one using the entire Blinn-Phong model.
    </b></blockquote>

    <p>
      Blinn-Phong shading models surfaces which are mostly diffuse, but have some specular reflections when light hits the surface at just the right angle. It is made up of three components: the ambient lighting, the diffuse shading, and the specular reflection. The ambient lighting is a baseline level of light the object has. Diffuse lighting is modeled by light being scattered equally in all directions, with the illuminance proportional to the cosine of the angle of the light ray made with the normal. Specular lighting happens when the viewing angle is very close to the reflected ray of light.

    <p>
      The coarseness of the sphere mesh is very important for displacement mapping. This is because displacement mapping has to do with perturbing the existing vertices,the amount of detail is limited by the number of vertices in the mesh. In the picture above on the bottom right, the mesh is not fine enough to realize the differences in the displacement texture, so the sphere looks uniform, albeit low-poly. Whereas, on the left, we can start to see the checkered squares showing up because there are enough vertices to sample different values in the texture.
